Bamboo uses the Symfony framework but our components are\nframework agnostic, that is, they only depend on the Symfony components as \nopposed to the whole framework or any of its distributions.\n\n\nWhy should I use Bamboo? That's simple, to sell your products. We provide you \nwith an interface to sell your products and manage your store. You only have to \nfocus on offering a good product, we take care of the rest.\n\n\nRequirements\n #\n\n\nWe're trying to build this project with a light default dependencies. These are\nours.\n\n\nPHP\n #\n\n\nTo use Bamboo and Elcodi you need a PHP version not lower than \n5.4\n. For more \ninfo just visit their \ninstallation page\n\n\nPHP GD\n #\n\n\n\n\nThis PHP extension is used to being already installed when you add PHP in your\ndistribution\n\n\n\n\nImages are a really important part of an store.

By default we use MySQL, remember to install\nit as well as its extension for PHP. For more info just visit their\n\ninstallation page\n\n\nComposer\n #\n\n\nComposer\n is required to manage dependencies.\n\n\nif you have not yet installed Composer, download it following the instructions\non \nhttp://getcomposer.org/\n or just run the following\ncommand:\n\n\n$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n #\n\n\nIf you're used to working with LAMP environment, then you will have Bamboo \nrunning in your computer in less than 5 minutes.\n\n\n1.

            "text": "Cart Architecture\n #\n\n\nThis is one of the most important parts of the whole project. How Elcodi's cart\nworks? How it's been designed? And how can I deal with it?\n\n\nWe will show you how we have designed all the model and why have we decided this\narchitecture. It is important for you to understand the design in order to\ndetect all possible entries and modification points, to make the Cart component as\nmuch customized as you need.\n\n\nIntroduction\n #\n\n\nLet's start by determining what the Cart Component should take care about. Well,\nit's not difficult at all, so we are working in an E-commerce. The component itself\ntakes care about all related to the Cart and the Order. The component provides\nyou a complete service layer for your application, so knowing and understanding\nthis layer will help you a lot in your own implementation.\n\n\nWe will split all the model in two parts, the Cart part and the Order part. Both\nparts are connected but they can (and should) be treated in a very isolated way.\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, forget about the Purchasable instance. This is just the way we\nwill refer to the concept of Product (please, read the \n\nProduct Architecture\n chapter in order to know more\nabout it. Let's focus on how the Cart and Order are built.\n\n\nCart\n #\n\n\nThe bucket itself. Every customer has it's own cart, and it's life is connected\nto the session and to the customer as well. This means that even if you change\nthe device, and as long as you're logged in, then you will be able to retrieve\nthe cart from the database.\n\n\nSome parts of the cart are not stored in database, like the prices. Because of\nsome products from your cart can be disabled between page views, or because\ntheir prices can be modified as well, every time you request your cart, prices\nare reloaded and saved locally, in your object life. Of course, this means two\nthings:\n\n\n\n\nYour cart loading consumes some resources in each request\n\n\nYou cannot lookup in your database by these values\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, this strategy helps a lot in your stored carts status. This means that\nyou will not store invalid prices.\n\n\nThe Cart model introduces a new object called Cart Line.\n\n\nCart Line\n #\n\n\nEverytime a new purchasable object is added into a Cart, you must save, at\nleast, one extra information about this relation (cart and purchasable): the\nquantity. Because of this, you cannot relate directly both elements. Of course,\nif the purchasable object needs more information about the relation, for example\ncolor, size or any single text, you should save them all as well.\n\n\nFor this, we will work with an extra man-in-the-middle class called CartLine. In\nthis class we'll save the Cart, the purchasable object and all this information.\nCartLine is designed using\n\nObject Composition\n. It means\nthat the life of all CartLine instances are coupled to the life of the Cart\ninstance.\n\n\n\n\nLoading the cart\n #\n\n\nAs we said, the cart is loaded each time, but, who loads it? In fact, and\nbecause of our service layer, you will find that loading cart is as easy as\nusing an event dispatcher called \nelcodi.event_dispatcher.cart\n.\n\n\n$cart = $this\n    -\ncartRepository\n    -\nfind(1);\n\n$this\n    -\ncartEventDispatcher\n    -\ndispatchCartLoadEvents($cart);\n\n\n\n\nLet's check as well how to inject the event listener. In that case we are\ninjecting both the event dispatcher and the cart repository, for cart\nretrieving.\n\n\nservices:\n    my_cart_loader:\n        class: My\\Cart\\Loader\\Class\n        arguments:\n            - @elcodi.repository.cart\n            - @elcodi.event_dispatcher.cart\n\n\n\n\nAfter that call, your cart will be completely loaded, including prices and\nchecks, and invalid cart lines will be safely removed. Of course, and because\nthe project uses a strong event layer, some events will be dispatched during the\nprocess.\n\n\n\n\ncart.preload\n\n\ncart.onload\n\n\ncart.inconsistent\n\n\n\n\nThe question then is... how can I know that a cart has been loaded? Well, easy\nindeed.\n\n\n$cart = $this\n    -\ncartRepository\n    -\nfind(1);\n\n$isLoaded = $cart-\nisLoaded();\n// $isLoaded === false\n\n$this\n    -\ncartEventDispatcher\n    -\ndispatchCartLoadEvents($cart);\n\n$isLoaded = $cart-\nisLoaded();\n// $isLoaded === true\n\n\n\n\nAdding Purchasables\n #\n\n\nThe main action of a cart is to add a new Product, right? Well, as you will see\nin the \nProduct architecture\n chapter, we are not\nworking with products, but with Purchasable instances.\n\n\nEach purchasable must be added into the cart by using the CartManager, a service\nthat is intended for managing Purchasables and Lines in a very intuitive way.\n\n\nLet's see a small example of how to use the service.\n\n\n$cart;\n$purchasable = $this\n    -\nproductFactory()\n    -\ncreate();\n\n$this\n    -\ncartManager\n    -\naddPurchasable(\n        $cart,\n        $purchasable,\n        3\n    );\n\n\n\n\nIn this example we have used the Product factory and the cart manager. Let's see\nthe dependency injection definition of the fictitious service.\n\n\nservices:\n    my_service:\n        class: My\\Service\\Namespace\n        arguments:\n            - @elcodi.factory.product\n            - @elcodi.manager.cart\n\n\n\n\nOf course, and because \nPurchasable\n is not a real class but an interface, we \nmust add any Purchasable implementation. Product and Variant are our \nimplementations, so in this example we use Product.\n\n\nAfter calling method \naddPurchasable\n, your cart will have 3 units of this \nproduct only if they are really available to be purchased. Otherwise, you will\nget some exceptions. The cart is automatically reloaded as well, and\nall prices are rebuilt again.\n\n\nThis method dispatches these events:\n* \ncart_line.onadd\n\n\nRemoving Purchasables\n #\n\n\nYou can remove purchasables as well, by using another method in the service\nCartManager. Let's see an example using the same service and construction\ndefinition than before.\n\n\n$cart;\n$purchasable = $this\n    -\nproductFactory()\n    -\ncreate();\n\n$this\n    -\ncartManager\n    -\nremovePurchasable(\n        $cart,\n        $purchasable,\n        3\n    );\n\n\n\n\nAfter calling the method, your product units will be decreased as many times as\nthe last value of the call defines. If the value is higher or equal than the\nquantity of the purchasable in the cart, then this line is removed from the\ncart.\n\n\nAfter that, the cart is automatically reloaded as well, and all prices are\nrebuilt again.\n\n\nThis method dispatches these events:\n* \ncart_line.onadd\n only if the purchasable is removed\nfrom the cart\n\n\nAdding a coupon\n #\n\n\nYou can add some coupons as well in your cart. Because we think that both\nconcepts are not the same and shouldn't be coupled at all, we decided to\nseparate them in two components.\n\n\nBoth components have their own events, so all logic regarding how to add coupons\ninto the cart is placed in a third component called CartCoupon. To know a little\nbit more about coupons, please read\n\nCoupon Architecture\n chapter.\n\n\nFor adding a new coupon into the cart, you need to use the service\n\nCartCouponManager\n. This service has some interesting methods for the\nmanagement of all coupons in your cart.\n\n\nLet's see an example.\n\n\n$cart;\n$couponCode = 'coupon5%';\n\n$this\n    -\ncartCouponManager\n    -\naddCouponByCode(\n        $cart,\n        $couponCode\n    );\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that your service depends only on the cart coupon manager, then this\nshould be the dependency injection definition.\n\n\nservices:\n    my_service:\n        class: My\\Service\\Namespace\n        arguments:\n            - @elcodi.manager.cart_coupon\n\n\n\n\nAfter this action, the coupon is inserted into the cart and the values of the\ncart are recomputed. During the association of both elements, some\nproblems can occur, for example, when two incompatible coupons are inserted in\nthe same cart. Then, you have to expect specific exceptions.\n\n\nYou can add a coupon as well with the Coupon instance as well, using the same\nCartCouponManager.\n\n\n$cart;\n$couponCode = 'coupon5%';\n$coupon = $this\n    -\ncouponRepository\n    -\nfindOneByCode('coupon5%');\n\n$this\n    -\ncartCouponManager\n    -\naddCoupon(\n        $cart,\n        $coupon\n    );\n\n\n\n\nThe definition of that example is not the same than the last one, so this one\ndepends on the \nCouponRepository\n service as well.\n\n\nThis method dispatches these events:\n* \ncart_coupon.onapply\n\n\nRemoving a coupon\n #\n\n\nYou can remove a coupon from a cart using the same service than the\nlast example.\n\n\n$cart;\n$couponCode = 'coupon5%';\n\n$this\n    -\ncartCouponManager\n    -\nremoveCouponByCode(\n        $cart,\n        $couponCode\n    );\n\n\n\n\nYou can remove as well the coupon with the Coupon instance.\n\n\n$cart;\n$couponCode = 'coupon5%';\n$coupon = $this\n    -\ncouponRepository\n    -\nfindOneByCode('coupon5%');\n\n$this\n    -\ncartCouponManager\n    -\nremoveCoupon(\n        $cart,\n        $coupon\n    );\n\n\n\n\nAfter these actions, the cart is completely reloaded, like other actions.\n\n\nThis method dispatches these events:\n* \ncart_coupon.onremove\n\n\nGetting Cart coupons\n #\n\n\nGiven a cart, you should be able to get all coupons applied. We'll\nuse the same manager again.\n\n\n$cart;\n\n$cartCoupons = $this\n    -\ncartCouponManager\n    -\ngetCoupons();\n\n\n\n\nCart transformation\n #\n\n\nOnce the cart must be converted to an order, there is a nice transformer for\nthat occasion. Let's see an example of that transformation. In that occasion, we\nassume that \ngetLoadedCart()\n returns an already loaded cart.\n\n\n$cart = $this-\ngetLoadedCart();\n\n$order = $this\n    -\ncartOrderTransformer\n    -\ncreateOrderFromCart($cart);\n\n\n\n\nThis action produces as well some new events.\n\n\n\n\norder.precreated\n\n\norder.oncreated\n\n\norder_line.oncreated\n\n\n\n\nAfter this action, the cart becomes ordered\n\n\n$cart = $this-\ngetLoadedCart();\n\n$order = $this\n    -\ncartOrderTransformer\n    -\ncreateOrderFromCart($cart);\n\n$cartIsOrdered = $cart-\nisOrdered();\n// $cartIsOrdered === true\n\n\n\n\nOrder\n #\n\n\nThe order should always be a plain copy of a cart. Because the\nobject's behaviour should be as immutable as possible, all prices are calculated\nand saved in database.\n\n\n\n\nInside the entity, you will find this information:\n\n\n\n\nCart where the order belongs\n\n\nDimensions of the order (only physical orders)\n\n\nOrderLines, each one as a mirror of each CartLine\n\n\nQuantity of the order, total number of elements\n\n\nPrices from products, coupons, shipping and total.\n\n\nAddresses from delivering and billing\n\n\nOrder States\n\n\n\n\nGetting Order coupons\n #\n\n\nBecause both components are decoupled (cart and coupon), you need some\nmiddleware for the order coupons retrieval. For this reason, the project \nprovides a service called \nOrderCouponManager\n for the management of all order\ncoupons. Let's see a simple example about how we can retrieve all coupons from \nan Order instance.\n\n\n$order;\n\n$orderCoupons = $this\n    -\norderCouponManager\n    -\ngetCoupons($order);\n\n\n\n\nOrder states\n #\n\n\nWhen an order is created, each instance can travel through an amount of\npredefined states.\n\n\nWith the basic implementation, you will find defined state machines for payment\nand shipping. To know more about this, please, read the \nPayments\n\nand the \nShipping\n chapters",

Well, as you will see\nin the  Product architecture  chapter, we are not\nworking with products, but with Purchasable instances.  Each purchasable must be added into the cart by using the CartManager, a service\nthat is intended for managing Purchasables and Lines in a very intuitive way.  Let's see a small example of how to use the service.  $cart;\n$purchasable = $this\n    - productFactory()\n    - create();\n\n$this\n    - cartManager\n    - addPurchasable(\n        $cart,\n        $purchasable,\n        3\n    );  In this example we have used the Product factory and the cart manager. Let's see\nthe dependency injection definition of the fictitious service.  services:\n    my_service:\n        class: My\\Service\\Namespace\n        arguments:\n            - @elcodi.factory.product\n            - @elcodi.manager.cart  Of course, and because  Purchasable  is not a real class but an interface, we \nmust add any Purchasable implementation. Product and Variant are our \nimplementations, so in this example we use Product.  After calling method  addPurchasable , your cart will have 3 units of this \nproduct only if they are really available to be purchased. Otherwise, you will\nget some exceptions. The cart is automatically reloaded as well, and\nall prices are rebuilt again.  This method dispatches these events:\n*  cart_line.onadd",

If the value is higher or equal than the\nquantity of the purchasable in the cart, then this line is removed from the\ncart.  After that, the cart is automatically reloaded as well, and all prices are\nrebuilt again.

Both components have their own events, so all logic regarding how to add coupons\ninto the cart is placed in a third component called CartCoupon. To know a little\nbit more about coupons, please read Coupon Architecture  chapter.  For adding a new coupon into the cart, you need to use the service CartCouponManager . This service has some interesting methods for the\nmanagement of all coupons in your cart.  Let's see an example.  $cart;\n$couponCode = 'coupon5%';\n\n$this\n    - cartCouponManager\n    - addCouponByCode(\n        $cart,\n        $couponCode\n    );  Assuming that your service depends only on the cart coupon manager, then this\nshould be the dependency injection definition.  services:\n    my_service:\n        class: My\\Service\\Namespace\n        arguments:\n            - @elcodi.manager.cart_coupon  After this action, the coupon is inserted into the cart and the values of the\ncart are recomputed. During the association of both elements, some\nproblems can occur, for example, when two incompatible coupons are inserted in\nthe same cart. Then, you have to expect specific exceptions.  You can add a coupon as well with the Coupon instance as well, using the same\nCartCouponManager.  $cart;\n$couponCode = 'coupon5%';\n$coupon = $this\n    - couponRepository\n    - findOneByCode('coupon5%');\n\n$this\n    - cartCouponManager\n    - addCoupon(\n        $cart,\n        $coupon\n    );  The definition of that example is not the same than the last one, so this one\ndepends on the  CouponRepository  service as well.

This payment\nmethod will have a reference name called \nfree_payment\n, and even is not\nimportant at all what's the name, we will use it to detect how we should use the\nname, whatever it is, in our services and bundle implementation.\n\n\nOur payment method will be always available.\n\n\nCalling for Shipping methods\n #\n\n\nImagine that your cart is already completed and finished. Then it's time to pay\nit. Elcodi platform only provides you one single and easy way of collecting all\nthese methods.\n\n\nIt is important to understand that Elcodi will never consider throwing any kind\nof event related to any specific payment method neither any order paid related\none, so each integration should have their own events for that.\n\n\nIn other words, Elcodi only will provide a simple point of entry to the payment\nengine.\n\n\nAt the point we need to  want to collect all payment methods, we are going to\nuse the service created specifically for that.\n\n\n$paymentMethods = $this\n    -\nget('elcodi.wrapper.payment_methods')\n    -\nget();\n\n\n\n\nInternally, this piece of code dispatches an event called \n\n\"payment.collect\"\n, responsible exclusively for\ncollecting all these payment methods.\n\n\nIt is necessary to say that at this point, the Event Dispatcher component is not\nworking in a very strict way it should work, so it's being used as a collector\nmanager instead of an event dispatcher. The difference between both is that an\nevent should be inmutable (an event just happends, and there's no much to be\ndone then... just add some reactions using event listeners), but in that case,\nthe object Event has a \nhasXXX\n method, so, even not being imortant the order\nof the listeners execution, the event is being modified on the fly. A changer\nevent... weird, right?\n\n\n\n\nImplement a collector\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, the recollection event is dispatched and all installed and initialized\nPlugins (in Kernel) are called to add some payment methods there.\n\n\nAdding new Payment Method\n #\n\n\nFor you, developer, that you want to add a payment method, that's your chapter.\nRemember the event \n\"shipping.collect\"\n? Well, we\nmust listen it in order to add new payment methods.\n\n\nSince now, none object is passed though the event in order to decide if a\npayment method is available or not, so only the plugin statement should be\nchecked.\n\n\nLet's take a look firstly how can we subscribe to this event using the same\nmethodology of subscribing any event.\n\n\nservices:\n\n    #\n    # Event Listeners\n    #\n    elcodi_plugin.free_payment.event_listener.payment_collect:\n        class: Elcodi\\Plugin\\FreePayment\\EventListener\\PaymentCollectEventListener\n        tags:\n            - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: payment.collect, method: addCustomPaymentMethods }\n\n\n\n\nGreat. In this Event Listener we should add all our business logic (of course,\nis much better to place all your business logic inside a service, but it depends\non your strategy). We'll doing like this in this example. Let's take a look.\n\n\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\Currency\\Entity\\Money;\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\Payment\\Entity\\PaymentMethod;\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\Payment\\Event\\PaymentCollectionEvent;\n\n/**\n * Class PaymentCollectEventListener\n */\nclass PaymentCollectEventListener\n{\n    /**\n     * Look for available payment methods\n     *\n     * @param PaymentCollectionEvent $event Event\n     *\n     * @return $this Self object\n     */\n    public function addCustomPaymentMethods(PaymentCollectionEvent $event)\n    {\n        $event\n            -\naddPaymentMethod(new PaymentMethod(\n                'free-payment',\n                'Your order for free!',\n                'You can buy whatever you want for free!',\n                'http://my-free-payment.com',\n                'http://my-free-payment.com/logo.png,\n                '\nscript\n/script\n'\n            ));\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, when we create a new instance of the object \nPaymentMethod\n you\ncan add some properties like \nurl\n, \nimageUrl\n and \nscript\n.\n\n\nnamespace Elcodi\\Component\\Payment\\Entity;\n\n/**\n * Class PaymentMethod\n */\nclass PaymentMethod\n{\n    /**\n     * Construct\n     *\n     * @param string $id          Id\n     * @param string $name        Name\n     * @param string $description Description\n     * @param string $url         Url\n     * @param string $imageUrl    Image url\n     * @param string $script      Script\n     */\n    public function __construct(\n        $id,\n        $name,\n        $description,\n        $url,\n        $imageUrl = '',\n        $script = ''\n    ) {\n        $this-\nid = $id;\n        $this-\nname = $name;\n        $this-\ndescription = $description;\n        $this-\nurl = $url;\n        $this-\nimageUrl = $imageUrl;\n        $this-\nscript = $script;\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis is because, in most cases, a payment platform, or in all middleware\nintegrations, we are used to working with one of these scenarios:\n\n\n\n\nThe platform proposes us an external url with an associated image. It is\ncommon to see this when our user must jump to another domain for the payment\naction. In that case, we should use both \nurl\n and \nimageUrl\n.\n\n\nThe platform provides us an script with HTML and some JS.

Indeed,\nthis question has a very fast abstract answer that will, surely, give you some\nextra calmness.\n\n\nA Plugin is a Bundle.\n\n\nYes, when we talk about Plugins, we talk about Symfony Bundles, with a simple \nand pre-defined specification. And is this specification what we will show you\nproperly, in order to help you understanding existing plugins and composing new\nones.\n\n\nWhat is a Bundle?\n #\n\n\nLike any Bundle, a Plugin needs to have its own Bundle class. This is usually\nplaced in the root of the bundle, and should be called as much specifically as\npossible, in order to avoid collisions.\n\n\n\n\nEven if two bundles share the same name, the uniqueness of each Plugin is \ndefined by its namespace, so even in this scenario, your Elcodi installation\nwill work properly.\n\n\n\n\nLet's see an example of a bundle. We will work along this document with our\nfirst Plugin, the DisqusBundle.\n\n\nnamespace Elcodi\\Plugin\\DisqusBundle;\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Bundle\\Bundle;\n\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\Plugin\\Interfaces\\PluginInterface;\n\n/**\n * Class ElcodiDisqusBundle\n */\nclass ElcodiDisqusBundle extends Bundle implements PluginInterface\n{\n    // ...\n}\n\n\n\n\nImplementing \nPluginInterface\n is the way the kernel has to identify if a bundle\nhas to be treated as a Plugin\n\n\nWhy plugins?\n #\n\n\nThat's one of the most important parts of our philosophy. We will give some \nreasons to have a plugin-driven design.\n\n\n\n\nBecause you will design decoupled from the core. This means that, if you\nupdate Elcodi and Bamboo with new features (remember, using semantic version),\nthere wont be the possibility to have conflicts. You only develop your own \nplugins, based on the master project.\n\n\nBecause you can share. If you overwrite some parts of the project proposing\nnew business logic, and if you take care about related documentation, then you\ncan share your work, and even sell it.\n\n\nBecause will help you with the development of the package. Your code will be\ncleaner and more testable... and this is always good news.\n\n\nBecause you will follow Elcodi style. All these proposed reasons is what makes\nElcodi a good project to work with. Following our structure will help this\necosystem to grow day by day, and this is what will make Elcodi a successful \nproject indeed.\n\n\n\n\nPlugin dependencies\n #\n\n\nAll plugins are extending the main project, but some of them have some \ndependencies. Remember that Elcodi has it's own bundle dependencies resolver.\nPlease, read careful this chapter in order to understand how to define properly\nthese dependencies.\n\n\nHow to Install dependent Bundles\n\n\nPlugin definition\n #\n\n\nThere is a very simple way to define a Plugin. What is the name of the plugin, \nwhat are the fields that will configure it, and some more information is what\nyou will have to place in the \nplugin.yml\n file.\n\n\n\n\nThis file must be placed in the root of the Bundle\n\n\n\n\nLet's see an example of how the DisqusPlugin is configured.\n\n\nplugin:\n    type: plugin\n    category: comments\n    name: Discuss\n    description: |\n        Disqus integration for your shop\n    fa_icon: comment-o\n    fields:\n        disqus_identifier:\n            type: text\n            label: elcodi_plugin.disqus.disqus_identifier\n        disqus_enabled_product:\n            type: checkbox\n            label: elcodi_plugin.disqus.disqus_enabled_product\n        disqus_enabled_blog_post:\n            type: checkbox\n            label: elcodi_plugin.disqus.disqus_enabled_blog_post\n\n\n\n\nEach definition is considered as a configuration element, and all these are\navailable.\n\n\n\n\ntype: You must define your Plugin as a simple plugin or as a template. Of \ncourse this value is required. Available values are \nplugin\n or \ntemplate\n.\n\n\ncategory: You can tag it as well using a specific category. Each category is\nmeant to be treated in a different specific way. Specific and useful values\nare \npayment\n, \nshipping\n and \nsocial\n. If none value is specified, then will\nnot belong to any category.\n\n\nname: The name of your plugin\n\n\nvisible: This plugin will be visible for its configuration. By default, this\nvalue is set as true.\n\n\nfa_icon: Icon used, following the \nAwesome Fonts\n \nformat\n\n\ndescription: Plugin description\n\n\nfields: Set of configurable fields\n\n\n\n\nPlugin fields\n #\n\n\nWhat is a field? Well, your plugins may require some values to be stored in\nyour database related to the plugin. For example, an \napi_public_key\n or a \nsimple \nusername\n.\n\n\nThese values are stored in a plain way, and because is important to make easy\nthe management of these values, Bamboo will provide automatically your Plugin\nconfiguration page, only by defining how these fields should be created. These\nare all possibilities\n\n\n\n\ntype: Type of the field. This value will be used as field type in form\n\n\nrequired: This field must be configured in order to use this plugin\n\n\ndata: The value of the field\n\n\nlabel: Label of the field (You can use translations)\n\n\noptions: Array of options, needed if your field is checkbox or radio.\n\n\nattr: Array of attributes\n\n\n\n\nLet's see an example. If our plugin require a text field called username...\n\n\nplugin:\n    type: plugin\n    category: social\n    name: Twitter\n    description: |\n        Twitter integration for your shop\n    fa_icon: twitter-o\n    fields:\n        username:\n            type: text\n            label: elcodi_plugin.twitter.username\n            required: true\n\n\n\n\nWith this example, your Bamboo installation will provide you a nice page with\na very simple way of defining the twitter username.\n\n\nA little bit later you will find the way of retrieving these values. \n\n\nDependency Injection\n #\n\n\nA plugin is a Bundle, remember? This means that you should define a set of \nservices in the same way you do when you create your amazing bundles.\n\n\nYou can follow the Elcodi way by reading some cookbooks in this documentation,\nso you will make sure that everybody will understand more easily what you're \ntrying to do.\n\n\n\n\nHow to install dependent Bundles\n\n\nExtensions\n\n\nSome Dependency Injection standards\n\n\n\n\nRemember to follow some of our philosophy.

Please, see the full list in the Plugin\ndefinition chapter.\n\n\n$pluginCategory = $this\n    -\nplugin\n    -\ngetConfigurationValue('category');\n\n\n\n\ngetFieldValue()\n #\n\n\nRemember our last example?

If you have configured your plugin the right way, then you should have\nyour Plugin configuration panel in the admin side.\n\n\nHow to Install a plugin\n\n\nAfter loading the plugin, of course, you need to add it in your AppKernel file.\nBecause some plugins have dependencies and because it's main mission is \noverwriting logic, you should instantiate them at the end of the class.\n\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Config\\Loader\\LoaderInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Kernel;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Bundle\\BundleInterface;\n\nuse Elcodi\\Bundle\\CoreBundle\\Traits\\BundleDependenciesResolver;\n\n/**\n * Class AppKernel\n */\nclass AppKernel extends Kernel\n{\n    use BundleDependenciesResolver;\n\n    /**\n     * Returns an array of bundles to register.\n     *\n     * @return BundleInterface[] An array of bundle instances.\n     *\n     * @api\n     */\n    public function registerBundles()\n    {\n        $bundles = array(\n\n            /**\n             * All Symfony, Bamboo and Elcodi bundles\n             * with their dependencies\n             */\n\n            // ...\n\n            /**\n             * Elcodi Plugins\n             */\n            new My\\Elcodi\\Plugin(),\n            new My\\Second\\Elcodi\\Plugin(),\n        );\n\n        return $this\n            -\ngetBundleInstances(\n                $this,\n                $bundles\n            );\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOverwriting model\n #\n\n\nOne of the main goals of a plugin is overwriting the model. Of course you will\nhave to overwrite your desired entities, and old ones will not be used anymore\nas the main entity (unless you extend them, of course).\n\n\nYou can take a look at these chapters in order to understand properly how easy\nis overwriting the Elcodi model.\n\n\nHow to implement an entity\n\n\nHow to overwrite an entity\n\n\nIf a plugin overwrites a new entity or creates new entities that depends on \nexisting ones, then these dependant bundles that own these entities become \ndependencies of the plugins itself. Ensure that they are defined as such.\n\n\nOverwriting services\n #\n\n\nLike model, service layer is overwritable by using the same philosophy than the\nSymfony way. You will find some nice information in the Symfony documentation\nabout how to overwrite any part of the bundle, and in some of our cookbooks.\n\n\nHow to Override any Part of a Bundle\n\n\nHow to overwrite a service\n\n\nOf course, you can overwrite some parameters\n\n\nHow to overwrite a parameter\n\n\nAdding configuration\n #\n\n\nOne of the main plugin responsibilities (and needs many times) is to add\nconfiguration values into the main project. This means that not only should be\nresponsible of adding it's own configuration but add configuration related to\nother bundles.\n\n\nThere is a very easy way of doing this, assuming that the bundle you need to\nconfigure is already a dependency of your plugin, or at least that your plugin\nis being loaded after the configurable bundle in the kernel file.\n\n\nYou only have to create a new file called \nexternal.yml\n inside the folder\n\n@MyPlugin/Resources/config/external.yml\n and add all the configuration there.\n\n\nThis file will be appended by a Compiler Pass into the master config file, so\nafter compiled, the container will take in account this data as well.\n\n\nAdding routes\n #\n\n\nAnother useful action you might need inside a Plugin is to add some routes in\nthe master routing file.\n\n\nIn fact, you don't need to modify the routing master file to add new routes. You\nonly need to create a new file called \nrouting.yml\n inside the folder\n\n@MyPlugin/Resources/config/routing.yml\n and after flushing the cache, your\nproject will automatically detect new routes.\n\n\nAdding listeners\n #\n\n\nPart of a plugin should be as well adding some new cool behavior to your\nproject, and the cleanest way of doing that is by adding some listeners to our\nevents.\n\n\nPlease, take a look at our event list.\n\n\nElcodi Events",

If\nyou sell for example single cakes, then each cake is a product, and that should\nbe enough. Don't over-engineer your domain and project too much.\n\n\nIn other cases, for example if your e-commerce is selling some retail, then each\nProduct will have some variations. Let's see what a variation is and how we can\nimplement it in Elcodi.\n\n\nVariant\n #\n\n\nA Variant is a simple variation of a Product. Returning to the example of\nT-shirts, maybe you want to sell the same T-shirt in several colors, several\nsizes and several logos behind it.\n\n\nOne option is having one single product per each combination, and that would be\na good approach indeed, but then you have no way of controlling all products\nthat belong to the same family. For example, if all variations have the same\nprice then you should add it several times in several instances. As soon as this\nprice changes, then you need to change it all around.\n\n\nBad choice, right?\n\n\nIf you have only one Product called T-shirt and you create the right structure\nfor maintaining some Attributes and some Values, then you can create several\nVariants, each one containing one or more Values. Because a Variant is a\nPurchasable as well, then you can add them as well in your Cart.\n\n\nFirst of all, let's see how to create a variant, assuming we have the previous\nproduct created.\n\n\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\Product\\Entity\\Product;\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\Product\\Entity\\Variant;\n\n$product = new Product();\n$product\n    -\nsetName('T-shirt, Dora the explorer')\n    -\nsetDescription('T-shirt of Dora');\n\n$variant = new Variant\n$variant\n    -\nsetSku('12341234')\n    -\nsetStock(10)\n    -\nsetName('Blue XL T-shirt with the logo')\n    -\nsetProduct($product);\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the right way in Elcodi is always using factories instead of creating\nnew instances by hand.\n\n\n$product = $this\n    -\nproductFactory\n    -\ncreate()\n    -\nsetName('T-shirt, Dora the explorer')\n    -\nsetDescription('T-shirt of Dora');\n\n$variant = $this\n    -\nvariantFactory\n    -\ncreate()\n    -\nsetSku('12341234')\n    -\nsetStock(10)\n    -\nsetName('Blue XL T-shirt with the logo')\n    -\nsetProduct($product);\n\n\n\n\nThis service should have this dependency injection definition\n\n\nservices:\n    my_service:\n        class: My\\Service\\Namespace\n        arguments:\n            - @elcodi.factory.product\n            - @elcodi.factory.variant\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, that code is not useful at all, so none of these variants have\nattributes. Next step, creating a map of configurations for these Variants.\n\n\nAttributes\n #\n\n\nA variant is composed by different attribute values. Let's check it out by using\nthe last example. T-shirt of Dora the explorer is available in colors blue, red\nand green. Each one can be purchased in several sizes: S, M and L.\n\n\nEach Variant is a Product and one of each attribute, called Value. So, there is\none Variant that will have internally the Value blue of the Attribute color, and\nthe Value S of the Attribute Size.\n\n\nAssuming the piece of code we did before about product and variant...\n\n\n$product = //;\n$variant = //;\n\n$attribute = $this\n    -\nattributeFactory\n    -\ncreate()\n    -\nsetName('size');\n\n$value = $this\n    -\nvalueFactory\n    -\ncreate()\n    -\nsetValue('S')\n    -\nsetAttribute($attribute);\n\n$variant-\nsetValue($value);\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the relation is done between the Attribute and the Value, but\nbecause one Value can only have one Attribute, then the relation is done as well\nbetween the Variant and the Attribute.\n\n\n$attribute = $variant\n    -\ngetValue()\n    -\ngetAttribute();\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer\n #\n\n\nA product (and because a Product is always the master piece of any purchasable)\ncan have a manufacturer.

First of all, let's see how to create a variant, assuming we have the previous\nproduct created.  use Elcodi\\Component\\Product\\Entity\\Product;\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\Product\\Entity\\Variant;\n\n$product = new Product();\n$product\n    - setName('T-shirt, Dora the explorer')\n    - setDescription('T-shirt of Dora');\n\n$variant = new Variant\n$variant\n    - setSku('12341234')\n    - setStock(10)\n    - setName('Blue XL T-shirt with the logo')\n    - setProduct($product);  Of course, the right way in Elcodi is always using factories instead of creating\nnew instances by hand.  $product = $this\n    - productFactory\n    - create()\n    - setName('T-shirt, Dora the explorer')\n    - setDescription('T-shirt of Dora');\n\n$variant = $this\n    - variantFactory\n    - create()\n    - setSku('12341234')\n    - setStock(10)\n    - setName('Blue XL T-shirt with the logo')\n    - setProduct($product);  This service should have this dependency injection definition  services:\n    my_service:\n        class: My\\Service\\Namespace\n        arguments:\n            - @elcodi.factory.product\n            - @elcodi.factory.variant  In fact, that code is not useful at all, so none of these variants have\nattributes.

So, there is\none Variant that will have internally the Value blue of the Attribute color, and\nthe Value S of the Attribute Size.

Esta l\u00f3gica de \nnegocio puede ser tan compleja como sea necesario, por lo que la vamos a \nesconder tras un m\u00e9todo llamado \nisCartSatisfied()\n.\n\n\nLo m\u00e1s normal es que se utilizen librer\u00edas externas de PHP para dichas \nintegraciones, por lo que toda la documentaci\u00f3n al respecto ser\u00e1 relativa a como\nimplementar utilizar dichas integraciones.\n\n\nCalling for Shipping methods\n #\n\n\nUno de los componentes de Elcodi es el de Shipping. Dicho componente tiene un\nsolo objetivo, y es proporcionar al proyecto una forma limpia y desacoplada de\na\u00f1adir opciones de env\u00edo al comprador.\n\n\nPara esto debemos tener acceso al Cart del comprador, pues este ser\u00e1 el objeto\ncon el que podremos determinar cuales de los m\u00e9todos de env\u00edo son accesibles.\n\n\nEn el momento en que nuestro sistema acepta que no habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s cambios de Cart (no\nda opci\u00f3n a a\u00f1adir m\u00e1s productos o coupones), y para recopilar todos los m\u00e9todos\nde env\u00edo accesibles, vamos a tener este trozo de c\u00f3digo.\n\n\n$cart = $this\n    -\ncontainer\n    -\nget(\nelcodi.wrapper.cart\n)\n    -\nget();\n\n$shippingMethods = $this\n    -\nget('elcodi.wrapper.shipping_methods')\n    -\nget($cart);\n\n\n\n\nInternamente, este trozo de c\u00f3digo lanza un evento llamado \n\n\"shipping.collect\"\n, encargado exclusivamente de\nrecolectar todos estos m\u00e9todos de env\u00edo.\n\n\nEs necesario decir que en este punto, el componente Event Dispatcher de Symfony\nno se est\u00e1 utilizando de forma estricta a su definici\u00f3n, pues s\u00e9 utiliza como \ncolector y no como evento. La diferencia es que un evento deber\u00eda ser inmutable\n(un evento pasa y no hay mucho que hacer, solo reaccionar con los event \nlisteners), pero en este caso, el objeto evento tiene un m\u00e9todo \nadd\n, por lo\nque, a\u00fan no importando realmente el orden de ejecuci\u00f3n de los listeners, se est\u00e1\nmodificando el propio evento. Un evento que cambia... esto es raro, verdad?\n\n\n\n\nImplement a collector\n\n\n\n\nPero bueno, el evento de recolecci\u00f3n es lanzado, y todos los Plugins que est\u00e1n\nescuchados son llamados a a\u00f1adir sus m\u00e9todos a partir del Cart proporcionado\npor el evento\n\n\nAdding new Shipping Methods\n #\n\n\nPara t\u00ed, programador, que quieres a\u00f1adir un m\u00e9todo de env\u00edo, este es tu sitio.\nRecuerdas el evento \n\"shipping.collect\"\n? Pues \nbien, debemos escucharlo para a\u00f1adir nuestras formas de env\u00edo.\n\n\nPara nuestro ejemplo, debemos considerar si nuestro Cart cumple las espectativas\nque nosotros queremos, y de ser as\u00ed, a\u00f1adir un nuevo sistema de env\u00edo gratuito.\n\n\nVeamos primero como podemos suscribirnos a este evento utilizando la misma forma\nen que nos suscribimos a cualquier otro evento.\n\n\nservices:\n\n    #\n    # Event Listeners\n    #\n    elcodi_plugin.easy_free_shipping.event_listener.shipping_collect:\n        class: Elcodi\\Plugin\\EasyFreeShipping\\EventListener\\ShippingCollectEventListener\n        tags:\n            - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: shipping.collect, method: addCustomShippingMethods }\n\n\n\n\nBien.

Dicho componente tiene un\nsolo objetivo, y es proporcionar al proyecto una forma limpia y desacoplada de\na\u00f1adir opciones de env\u00edo al comprador.  Para esto debemos tener acceso al Cart del comprador, pues este ser\u00e1 el objeto\ncon el que podremos determinar cuales de los m\u00e9todos de env\u00edo son accesibles.  En el momento en que nuestro sistema acepta que no habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s cambios de Cart (no\nda opci\u00f3n a a\u00f1adir m\u00e1s productos o coupones), y para recopilar todos los m\u00e9todos\nde env\u00edo accesibles, vamos a tener este trozo de c\u00f3digo.  $cart = $this\n    - container\n    - get( elcodi.wrapper.cart )\n    - get();\n\n$shippingMethods = $this\n    - get('elcodi.wrapper.shipping_methods')\n    - get($cart);  Internamente, este trozo de c\u00f3digo lanza un evento llamado  \"shipping.collect\" , encargado exclusivamente de\nrecolectar todos estos m\u00e9todos de env\u00edo.  Es necesario decir que en este punto, el componente Event Dispatcher de Symfony\nno se est\u00e1 utilizando de forma estricta a su definici\u00f3n, pues s\u00e9 utiliza como \ncolector y no como evento. La diferencia es que un evento deber\u00eda ser inmutable\n(un evento pasa y no hay mucho que hacer, solo reaccionar con los event \nlisteners), pero en este caso, el objeto evento tiene un m\u00e9todo  add , por lo\nque, a\u00fan no importando realmente el orden de ejecuci\u00f3n de los listeners, se est\u00e1\nmodificando el propio evento. Un evento que cambia... esto es raro, verdad?   Implement a collector   Pero bueno, el evento de recolecci\u00f3n es lanzado, y todos los Plugins que est\u00e1n\nescuchados son llamados a a\u00f1adir sus m\u00e9todos a partir del Cart proporcionado\npor el evento",

In our team, \nsome people place the braces at the end of the class definition, while other\npeople place them in a new line.\n\n\nIs anyone wrong? Absolutely not, even PHP has standards since long time\nago, and besides anyone should also be able to work the way they want.\n\n\nBut in Elcodi we have some standards for our code.\n\n\nPackages Structure\n #\n\n\nA component must be treated as a simple PHP library. This means that it must be\nframework agnostic. At the beginning, Elcodi was a set of Bundles, divided by\nconcerns or boundaries, and implemented as a single Symfony-framework Bundle.\n\n\nThis was the root of some disagreements, and of course, like every single\nimplementation of Open Source, but we noticed that there was an opinion repeated\nonce and again by some users.\n\n\n\n\nThis project is Framework dependent.\n\n\n\n\nWe thought that being a Symfony dependent project was a good idea, but we had to \ndecide what to be dependent on. Finally, we decided that Elcodi had to be\ncoupled to Symfony components and Doctrine library, so we had to split between\nsimple PHP libraries (Components) and Symfony Framework adaptations of these\nlibraries (Bundles).\n\n\nComponent Structure\n #\n\n\nAs we have said before, a component is just a PHP library. Think about it, we could use the Cart\nclasses in our own project, far from Symfony Framework, and because we don't \nwant all the Framework dependencies inside our \nvendor/\n folder, maybe we should\nonly require the classes and their dependencies.\n\n\nThis is what a component is. Just classes.\n\n\nSo inside a component you will find a simple categorization of objects. All \ncomponents follow the same structure.\n\n\nCart\n  |\n  |- Entity\n  |    |- Interfaces\n  |    |    |- CartInterface.php\n  |    |- Abstracts\n  |    |    |- AbstractCart.php\n  |    |- Cart.php\n  |\n  |- Factory\n  |    |- CartFactory.php\n  |\n  |- Repository\n  |    |- CartRepository.php\n  |\n  |- Services\n  |    |- CartManager.php\n  |\n  |- Wrapper\n  |    |- CartWrapper.php\n  |\n  |- Transformer\n  |    |- CartOrderTransformer.php\n  |\n  |- Event\n  |    |- OnOrderCreatedEvent.php\n  |\n  |- EventListener\n  |    |- CartEventListener.php\n  |\n  |- EventDispatcher\n  |    |- CartEventDispatcher.php\n  |\n  |- Controller\n  |    |- ImageUploadController.php\n  |\n  |- Command\n       |- SitemapProfileCommand.php\n\n\n\n\nThis is just a sample of how a Component is structured, and how you should \nstructure your project if you want to follow our way of doing things.\n\n\n\n\nThis does not mean that this one is the best way of structuring your code, or\ndoes not mean that there is not another way of doing it.

This library is a dependency of the project, but only in development \nenvironment, so while you are developing, if you have already updated your \ncomposer dependencies, you can run the fixer as follows:  php bin/php-formatter formatter:use:sort src/\nphp bin/php-formatter formatter:header:fix src/  Because the dependency is set using an specific version of the code, all \ndevelopers will fix the code the same way.",

Let's see an example.  use Mmoreram\\ControllerExtraBundle\\Annotation\\Entity as AnnotationEntity;\nuse Mmoreram\\ControllerExtraBundle\\Annotation\\Form as AnnotationForm;\nuse Sensio\\Bundle\\FrameworkExtraBundle\\Configuration\\Route;\nuse Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\Controller;\n\n/**\n * Cart controllers\n *\n * @Route(\n *      path =  /cart ,\n * )\n */\nclass CartController extends Controller\n{\n    /**\n     * Cart view\n     *\n     * @param FormView      $formView Form view\n     * @param CartInterface $cart     Cart\n     *\n     * @return Response Response\n     *\n     * @Route(\n     *      path =  ,\n     *      name =  store_cart_view ,\n     *      methods = { GET }\n     * )\n     *\n     * @AnnotationEntity(\n     *      class = {\n     *           factory  =  elcodi.wrapper.cart ,\n     *           method  =  loadCart ,\n     *           static  = false,\n     *      },\n     *      name =  cart \n     * )\n     * @AnnotationForm(\n     *      class =  store_cart_form_type_cart ,\n     *      name  =  formView ,\n     *      entity =  cart ,\n     * )\n     */\n    public function viewAction(\n        FormView $formView,\n        CartInterface $cart\n    ) {\n        // ...\n\n        return $this- renderTemplate(\n            'Pages:cart-view.html.twig',\n            [\n                // ...\n            ]\n        );\n    }\n}  You can find some documentation of both annotation packages   ControllerExtraBundle  SensioFrameworkExtraBundle   Please, before using annotations in your project make sure that you know how\nthey work and how to use them.

This implementation enables you to work with entities\ninstead of translations.\n\n\n/**\n * Interface EntityTranslatorInterface\n */\ninterface EntityTranslatorInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Translate object\n     *\n     * @param Object $object Object\n     * @param string $locale Locale to be translated\n     */\n    public function translate($object, $locale);\n\n    /**\n     * Saves object translations\n     *\n     * @param Object $object       Object\n     * @param array  $translations Translations\n     */\n    public function save($object, array $translations);\n}\n\n\n\n\nUsing the same configuration than before, lets see an example about how we can\nmanage our entity translations using this service.\n\n\n$product = new TranslatableProduct();\n$product\n    -\nsetId(1)\n    -\nsetName('productName');\n\n$entityTranslator-\nsave($product, [\n    'es' =\n [\n        'name' =\n 'el nombre',\n        'description' =\n 'la descripci\u00f3n',\n    ],\n    'en' =\n [\n        'name' =\n 'the name',\n        'description' =\n 'the description',\n        'anotherfield' =\n 'some value',\n    ],\n]);\n\n/**\n * At this point, all the data have been persisted to database and cached.\n * As you can see, the `translate` method returns the translated object, but\n * both objects are the same\n */\n\n$translatedProduct = $translator-\ntranslate($product, 'en');\n\n$translatedName = $translatedProduct-\ngetName();\necho $translatedName;\n// = \nthe name\n\n\n/**\n * So because both object are the same, you can just apply the translation\n * without using the returned object\n */\n\n$translator-\ntranslate($product, 'es');\n\n$translatedName = $product-\ngetName();\necho $translatedName;\n// = \nel nombre\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo when you save all the translations of an entity, the \nEntityTranslator\n will\nmake a unique flush to the persistence layer, in order to improve this action.\n\n\nUsing Doctrine\n #\n\n\nEasy and simple. Let's work with a simple entity mapped in Doctrine.\n\n\n/**\n * Class Product\n *\n * @ORM\\Entity\n */\nclass Product\n{\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     *\n     * @ORM\\Id\n     * @ORM\\Column\n     * @ORM\\GeneratedValue\n     *\n     * id\n     */\n    protected $id;\n\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     *\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=\nstring\n)\n     *\n     * Name\n     */\n    protected $name;\n\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     *\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=\ntext\n)\n     *\n     * Description\n     */\n    protected $description;\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis example will assume that you want to make both fields, name and\ndescription, translatable. To make it happen, we can simply remove  the mapping\nof both fields, to rely the responsibility of translation to the Translator\ncomponent.\n\n\n/**\n * Class Product\n *\n * @ORM\\Entity\n */\nclass Product\n{\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     *\n     * @ORM\\Id\n     * @ORM\\Column\n     * @ORM\\GeneratedValue\n     *\n     * id\n     */\n    protected $id;\n\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     *\n     * Name\n     */\n    protected $name;\n\n    /**\n     * @var string\n     *\n     * Description\n     */\n    protected $description;\n}\n\n\n\n\nNow your installation will see the Product as a simple id. Why is this good for\nus? This example uses Annotations, and we highly recommend to define all your\nmapping configuration using \nyml\n so you can easily decouple your model\nimplementation (entities) and your mapping configuration (Product.orm.yml) and\ndisable some fields for mapping with the same entity implementation.\n\n\nConfiguring the entity translator\n #\n\n\nNow, we need to configure the translator. You need to define what entities and\nfields you allow the engine to manage. Let's see the configuration for this\nexample.\n\n\nelcodi_entity_translator:\n    configuration:\n        My\\Bundle\\Entity\\Product:\n            alias: product\n\n            // idGetter, by default, getId\n            idGetter: getId\n            fields:\n                name:\n                    // getter, by default, getName in this case\n                    // setter, by default, setName in this case\n                    getter: getName\n                    setter: setName\n                description:\n                    getter: getDescription\n                    setter: setDescription\n\n\n\n\nThis is the basic definition of the Product translation. You can see that there\nis come specific information set by default, so indeed, this configuration could\nbe defined as well that way\n\n\nelcodi_entity_translator:\n    configuration:\n        My\\Bundle\\Entity\\Product:\n            alias: product\n            fields:\n                name: ~\n                description: ~\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Interfaces as well, so in that case, to ensure that the\nconfiguration will be still valid even if you change the Product implementation,\nyou can use an Interface for that\n\n\nelcodi_entity_translator:\n    configuration:\n        My\\Bundle\\Entity\\Interfaces\\ProductInterface:\n            alias: product\n            fields:\n                name: ~\n                description: ~\n\n\n\n\nSaving translations\n #\n\n\nDo you want to translate an entity? Great, let's do that! You can easily manage\nyour translation using the entity translator service.\n\n\n$entityTranslator = $this\n    -\ncontainer\n    -\nget('elcodi.entity_translator');\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have the service instance, you can set your entity translations in a\nvery simple way. In this example, let's create a new entity, let's save it into\ndatabase and let's translate it.\n\n\n$product = new Product();\n$product-\nsetId(1);\n\n$entityTranslator-\nsave($product, [\n    'es' =\n [\n        'name' =\n 'el nombre',\n        'description' =\n 'la descripci\u00f3n',\n    ],\n    'en' =\n [\n        'name' =\n 'the name',\n        'description' =\n 'the description',\n        'anotherfield' =\n 'some value',\n    ],\n]);\n\n\n\n\nTranslating an entity\n #\n\n\nSo, your entity is translated? Well, let's load the translations of an entity.\nYou only need the entity and the language you want it to be translated to.\n\n\n$product = $this\n    -\nget('doctrine.orm.entity_manager')\n    -\nfind(1);\n\n$entityTranslator-\ntranslate($product, 'en');\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's it. Your product is now translated to english, and because both\nfields, name and description, are not mapped anymore, you could flush the entity\nmanager and no information would be saved.\n\n\nTranslations in forms\n #\n\n\nThis is maybe the most important feature of this Bundle. How can we handle all\nthis stuff in our forms? Very simple. We don't have to change our form\ndefinition but only adapt it to add an EventSubscriber.\n\n\nLet's see an example.\n\n\nuse Elcodi\\Component\\EntityTranslator\\EventListener\\Traits\\EntityTranslatableFormTrait;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\AbstractType;\n\n/**\n * Class ProductType\n */\nclass ProductType extends AbstractType\n{\n    use EntityTranslatableFormTrait;\n\n    /**\n     * Buildform function\n     *\n     * @param FormBuilderInterface $builder the formBuilder\n     * @param array                $options the options for this form\n     */\n    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)\n    {\n        $builder\n            -\nadd('name', 'text', [\n                'required' =\n true,\n                'label'    =\n 'name',\n            ])\n            -\nadd('description', 'textarea', [\n                'required' =\n false,\n                'label'    =\n 'description',\n            ]);\n\n        $builder-\naddEventSubscriber($this-\ngetEntityTranslatorFormEventListener());\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Return unique name for this form\n     *\n     * @return string\n     */\n    public function getName()\n    {\n        return 'form_type_product';\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there are only two changes in this formType. First one is that\nyou must add this trait in order to add a protected variable and two methods.\nThe second change is that you must add the EventSubscriber the way is shown in\nthe example.\n\n\nBecause now the formType has some dependencies, you must define this formType as\na service in the dependency injection configuration.\n\n\nservices:\n    form_type.product:\n        class: My\\Namespace\\Form\\Type\\ProductType\n        calls:\n            - [setEntityTranslatorFormEventListener, [@elcodi.entity_translator_form_event_listener]]\n        tags:\n            - { name: form.type, alias: form_type_product }\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's it. Try to render your form, treating name and description like they\nwere normal fields and what you will see is that, instead of rendering a text\ninput field and a Textarea, three of each will be rendered.\n\n\nCustom form views\n #\n\n\nYou can easily customize the way of rendering these fields by adding some format\ninto the rendering of \ntranslatable_field\n. You can find more information in\nchapter - \nWhat are Form Themes?\n\n\nAutomatic entity translation\n #\n\n\nYou can enable the automatic translation of all loaded entities by enabling the\nrelated configuration flag \nauto_translate\n.\n\n\nelcodi_entity_translation:\n    auto_translate: true\n\n\n\n\nBy default this value is true. If true, every time you load a new entity from\nDoctrine than is defined as translatable (a field is included in the\nconfiguration), that entity will be translated using the current locale.",

If a product\nhas a page then we would like our sitemap to contain an entry url per product \npage. The items to index in a sitemap can be pages of products, categories, and \nany other entity on the project.\n\n\nWhen we talk about a block, we are really talking about a specific set of urls\nrelated to entities provided by a specific repository, for example all enabled \nproducts.\n\n\n# Each block defines a way of creating dynamically a set of elements of a\n# sitemap file, each one mapped from a database entry\nblocks:\n    enabled_products:\n        # Transformer\n        transformer: ~\n        # Repository service used for retrieving the array of entities\n        repository_service: elcodi.repository.product\n        # Repository method\n        method: findBy\n        # Array of arguments for the repository call\n        arguments:\n            enabled: true\n        # Specific change frequency for this block\n        changeFrequency: ~\n        # Specific priority for this block\n        priority: ~\n\n\n\n\nEach block needs a transformer, intended to transform an entity instance to \nevery single information needed by the sitemap generator. Every transformer must\nbe an implementation of SitemapTransformerInterface and must be defined as a\nservice in our Dependency Injection Container.\n\n\n/**\n * Interface SitemapTransformerInterface\n */\ninterface SitemapTransformerInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Get url given an entity\n     *\n     * @param Mixed  $element  Element\n     * @param string $language Language\n     *\n     * @return string url\n     */\n    public function getLoc($element, $language = null);\n\n    /**\n     * Get last mod\n     *\n     * @param Mixed  $element  Element\n     * @param string $language Language\n     *\n     * @return string Last mod value\n     */\n    public function getLastMod($element, $language = null);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen we need to pass the name of the service to the block configuration.\n\n\n# Each block defines a way of dynamically creating a set of elements of a\n# sitemap file, each one mapped from a database entry\nblocks:\n    enabled_products:\n        # Transformer\n        transformer: elcodi.sitemap_transformer.product\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis element is a mandatory and must be defined for each Block\n\n\n\n\nThat said, we need to also define how this product collection must be\nretrieved from our database. For this reason you must specify the\nrepository service, the method used and the arguments for such method.\n\n\n# Each block defines a way of dynamically creating a set of elements of a\n# sitemap file, each one mapped from a database entry\nblocks:\n    enabled_products:\n        repository_service: elcodi.repository.product\n        # Repository method\n        method: findBy\n        # Array of arguments for the repository call\n        arguments:\n            enabled: true\n            disabled: false\n\n\n\n\nThese elements are required and have no default values, to make sure\nthat every block definition is carefully defined and configured. \n\n\nFinally, we can define the \nchangeFrequency\n and the \npriority\n elements. Both\nvalues will be used for all block instances. They are not required.\n\n\n# Each block defines a way of dynamically creating a set of elements of a\n# sitemap file, each one mapped from a database entry\nblocks:\n    enabled_products:\n        # Specific change frequency for this block\n        changeFrequency: ~\n        # Specific priority for this block\n        priority: ~\n\n\n\n\nStatics\n #\n\n\nAn Static is a representation of a route, defined by its name and some \nnon-required values.\n\n\nelcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # Each static is a route entry\n    statics:\n        store_homepage:\n            # Specific change frequency for this static\n            changeFrequency: ~\n            # Specific priority for this static\n            priority: ~\n\n\n\n\nBuilders\n #\n\n\nA sitemap instance is built using a sorted set of Statics and Blocks and\nrendered by a specific renderer. The result of this built is dumped using a\nspecific dumper in a pre-defined path.\n\n\nelcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            # Set of block references\n            blocks:\n                - enabled_products\n            # Set of static references\n            statics:\n                - store_homepage\n            # Each builder can use a different renderer, by referencing the\n            # service definition\n            renderer: ~\n            # Each builder can use a different dumper, by referencing the\n            # service definition\n            dumper: ~\n            # You can define the name of the file, taking into account the locale\n            # used by using {_locale} format\n            path: %kernel.root_dir%/../web/sitemap/sitemap_{_locale}.xml\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all we need to define what blocks and statics we are going to use for\nsuch sitemap. It is important to know that the order matters.\n\n\nFor example, in our case, we will create a new sitemap called \nmain\n that will\ncontain a block and a static.\n\n\nelcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            # Set of block references\n            blocks:\n                - enabled_products\n            # Set of static references\n            statics:\n                - store_homepage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis component will first render the statics and then the blocks.\n\n\n\n\nThen, a renderer will transform this set of entries into a special format. By \ndefault this component gives you one renderer implementation, the \nXmlRenderer\n.\nThis implementation is the one used by default.\n\n\nelcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            # Each builder can use a different renderer, by referencing the\n            # service definition\n            renderer: ~\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use your own renderer, you can create a new service implementing \n\nSitemapRendererInterface\n.\n\n\n/**\n * Interface SitemapRendererInterface\n */\ninterface SitemapRendererInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Given an array of sitemapElements, renders the Sitemap\n     *\n     * @param SitemapElement[] $sitemapElements Elements\n     * @param string           $basepath        Base path\n     *\n     * @return string Render\n     */\n    public function render(array $sitemapElements, $basepath);\n}\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a dumper will dump your rendered data. By default this component gives\nyou one dumper implementation, the \nFilesystemDumper\n. This implementation is \nthe one used by default.\n\n\nelcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            dumper: ~\n            # You can define the name of the file, taking in account the locale\n            # used by using {_locale} format\n            path: %kernel.root_dir%/../web/sitemap/sitemap_{_locale}.xml\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to use your own dumper, you can create a new dumper implementing\n\nSitemapDumperInterface\n.\n\n\n/**\n * Interface SitemapDumperInterface\n */\ninterface SitemapDumperInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Dumps a sitemap given a path\n     *\n     * @param string $path    Path\n     * @param string $sitemap Sitemap\n     *\n     * @return $this Self object\n     */\n    public function dump($path, $sitemap);\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis dumper uses a path. This path is required by any defined builder and can\ncontain a placeholder for the sitemap language, using \n{_locale}\n.\n\n\nServices\n #\n\n\nElcodi generates a Dependency Injection service for each builder using our\nstandard. In our example, with given configuration we will have available a new\npublic service.\n\n\nelcodi.sitemap_builder.main\n\n\n\n\nCalling this service, the DI will create a SitemapBuilder instance, ready\nto be used.\n\n\n/**\n * Class SitemapBuilder\n */\nclass SitemapBuilder\n{\n    /**\n     * Build sitemap builder\n     *\n     * @param string      $basepath Base path\n     * @param string|null $language Language\n     *\n     * @return string Generated data\n     */\n    public function build($basepath, $language = null);\n}\n\n\n\n\nElcodi also generates a service for each dumper, using the same notation as\nbuilders.\n\n\nelcodi.sitemap_dumper.main\n\n\n\n\nCalling this service, the DI will create a SitemapDumper instance, ready\nto be used.\n\n\n/\n\n * Class SitemapDumper\n */\nclass SitemapDumper\n{\n    /\n\n     * Dump builder using a dumper\n     \n\n     * @param string      $basepath Base path\n     * @param string|null $language Language\n     \n/\n    public function dump($basepath, $language = null);\n}\n\n\nAs you can see, both services require the basepath of the site. It means that\nyou can call, for example, the \nbuild\n method using firstly the basepath \n\nhttp://localhost:8000\n and then \nhttps://myurl.com\n. Because this information\ndoes not belong to the instance but the call, it is mandatory to set this\ninformation when the sitemap is generated.\n\n\nYou must define the language as well, but this second parameter is not required.\nThis value is passed to the transformer, and your transformer implementation \nwill decide what to do with this language.\n\n\nDumper Command\n #\n\n\nThis command is intended for a single sitemap generation. You must provide the\nname of the builder as each builder has an associated dumper and a specific \nbasepath used for this built and an optional language.\n\n\nphp app/console elcodi:sitemap:dump main http://localhost:8000\nphp app/console elcodi:sitemap:dump main https://myurl.com\nphp app/console elcodi:sitemap:dump main http://localhost:8000 --language=es\n\n\n\n\nProfiles\n #\n\n\nUsing the dumper is so nice and easy if you just manage static languages, but\nhow about if our site needs to generate several builders using, for example, all \nthe enabled languages of our site?\n\n\nIn order to solve this common problem, this bundle provides as well what we call\na sitemap profile.\n\n\nelcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A profile is a set of builders, grouped and combined with all available\n    # languages. Special for bulk actions\n    profile:\n        main:\n            # Service reference, result which is an array of languages\n            languages: elcodi.languages_iso_array\n            # Set of builder references\n            builders:\n                - main\n\n\n\n\nThere are two elements to be defined here, both required.\n\n\nFirst, we need to decide what builders we want to include in this profile.\nThis is just a set of builders, an array. That easy.\n\n\nSecond, we must define a service in our project, intended to return all enabled\nlanguages in our site. This service must return an array of locales.\n\n\nIn elcodi we have a service called \nelcodi.languages_iso\n.\n\n\nelcodi.languages_iso_array:\n    class: stdClass\n    factory: [@elcodi.languages_iso, toArray]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, in Symfony a service can use the factory pattern to return a simple \narray using the stdClass keyword.\n\n\n\n\nElcodi generates a service for each profile, using our standard. In our example, \nwith the given configuration we will have available a new public service.\n\n\nelcodi.sitemap_profile.main\n\n\n\n\nCalling this service, the DI will create a SitemapProfile instance, ready\nto be used.\n\n\n/**\n * Class SitemapProfile\n */\nclass SitemapProfile\n{\n    /**\n     * Build full profile\n     *\n     * @param string $basepath Basepath\n     *\n     * @return $this Self object\n     */\n    public function dump($basepath);\n}\n\n\n\n\nProfile Command\n #\n\n\nThis command is intended for profile generation.

Every transformer must\nbe an implementation of SitemapTransformerInterface and must be defined as a\nservice in our Dependency Injection Container.  /**\n * Interface SitemapTransformerInterface\n */\ninterface SitemapTransformerInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Get url given an entity\n     *\n     * @param Mixed  $element  Element\n     * @param string $language Language\n     *\n     * @return string url\n     */\n    public function getLoc($element, $language = null);\n\n    /**\n     * Get last mod\n     *\n     * @param Mixed  $element  Element\n     * @param string $language Language\n     *\n     * @return string Last mod value\n     */\n    public function getLastMod($element, $language = null);\n}  Then we need to pass the name of the service to the block configuration.  # Each block defines a way of dynamically creating a set of elements of a\n# sitemap file, each one mapped from a database entry\nblocks:\n    enabled_products:\n        # Transformer\n        transformer: elcodi.sitemap_transformer.product   This element is a mandatory and must be defined for each Block   That said, we need to also define how this product collection must be\nretrieved from our database. For this reason you must specify the\nrepository service, the method used and the arguments for such method.  # Each block defines a way of dynamically creating a set of elements of a\n# sitemap file, each one mapped from a database entry\nblocks:\n    enabled_products:\n        repository_service: elcodi.repository.product\n        # Repository method\n        method: findBy\n        # Array of arguments for the repository call\n        arguments:\n            enabled: true\n            disabled: false  These elements are required and have no default values, to make sure\nthat every block definition is carefully defined and configured.   Finally, we can define the  changeFrequency  and the  priority  elements. Both\nvalues will be used for all block instances. They are not required.  # Each block defines a way of dynamically creating a set of elements of a\n# sitemap file, each one mapped from a database entry\nblocks:\n    enabled_products:\n        # Specific change frequency for this block\n        changeFrequency: ~\n        # Specific priority for this block\n        priority: ~  Statics  #  An Static is a representation of a route, defined by its name and some \nnon-required values.  elcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # Each static is a route entry\n    statics:\n        store_homepage:\n            # Specific change frequency for this static\n            changeFrequency: ~\n            # Specific priority for this static\n            priority: ~  Builders  #  A sitemap instance is built using a sorted set of Statics and Blocks and\nrendered by a specific renderer. The result of this built is dumped using a\nspecific dumper in a pre-defined path.  elcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            # Set of block references\n            blocks:\n                - enabled_products\n            # Set of static references\n            statics:\n                - store_homepage\n            # Each builder can use a different renderer, by referencing the\n            # service definition\n            renderer: ~\n            # Each builder can use a different dumper, by referencing the\n            # service definition\n            dumper: ~\n            # You can define the name of the file, taking into account the locale\n            # used by using {_locale} format\n            path: %kernel.root_dir%/../web/sitemap/sitemap_{_locale}.xml  First of all we need to define what blocks and statics we are going to use for\nsuch sitemap. It is important to know that the order matters.  For example, in our case, we will create a new sitemap called  main  that will\ncontain a block and a static.  elcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            # Set of block references\n            blocks:\n                - enabled_products\n            # Set of static references\n            statics:\n                - store_homepage   This component will first render the statics and then the blocks.   Then, a renderer will transform this set of entries into a special format. By \ndefault this component gives you one renderer implementation, the  XmlRenderer .\nThis implementation is the one used by default.  elcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            # Each builder can use a different renderer, by referencing the\n            # service definition\n            renderer: ~  If you want to use your own renderer, you can create a new service implementing  SitemapRendererInterface .  /**\n * Interface SitemapRendererInterface\n */\ninterface SitemapRendererInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Given an array of sitemapElements, renders the Sitemap\n     *\n     * @param SitemapElement[] $sitemapElements Elements\n     * @param string           $basepath        Base path\n     *\n     * @return string Render\n     */\n    public function render(array $sitemapElements, $basepath);\n}  Finally, a dumper will dump your rendered data. By default this component gives\nyou one dumper implementation, the  FilesystemDumper . This implementation is \nthe one used by default.  elcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A builder is a set of blocks and statics, grouped and saved to a file\n    builder:\n        main:\n            dumper: ~\n            # You can define the name of the file, taking in account the locale\n            # used by using {_locale} format\n            path: %kernel.root_dir%/../web/sitemap/sitemap_{_locale}.xml  If you want to use your own dumper, you can create a new dumper implementing SitemapDumperInterface .  /**\n * Interface SitemapDumperInterface\n */\ninterface SitemapDumperInterface\n{\n    /**\n     * Dumps a sitemap given a path\n     *\n     * @param string $path    Path\n     * @param string $sitemap Sitemap\n     *\n     * @return $this Self object\n     */\n    public function dump($path, $sitemap);\n}  This dumper uses a path. This path is required by any defined builder and can\ncontain a placeholder for the sitemap language, using  {_locale} .  Services  #  Elcodi generates a Dependency Injection service for each builder using our\nstandard. In our example, with given configuration we will have available a new\npublic service.  elcodi.sitemap_builder.main  Calling this service, the DI will create a SitemapBuilder instance, ready\nto be used.  /**\n * Class SitemapBuilder\n */\nclass SitemapBuilder\n{\n    /**\n     * Build sitemap builder\n     *\n     * @param string      $basepath Base path\n     * @param string|null $language Language\n     *\n     * @return string Generated data\n     */\n    public function build($basepath, $language = null);\n}  Elcodi also generates a service for each dumper, using the same notation as\nbuilders.  elcodi.sitemap_dumper.main  Calling this service, the DI will create a SitemapDumper instance, ready\nto be used.  / \n * Class SitemapDumper\n */\nclass SitemapDumper\n{\n    / \n     * Dump builder using a dumper\n      \n     * @param string      $basepath Base path\n     * @param string|null $language Language\n      /\n    public function dump($basepath, $language = null);\n}  As you can see, both services require the basepath of the site. It means that\nyou can call, for example, the  build  method using firstly the basepath  http://localhost:8000  and then  https://myurl.com . Because this information\ndoes not belong to the instance but the call, it is mandatory to set this\ninformation when the sitemap is generated.  You must define the language as well, but this second parameter is not required.\nThis value is passed to the transformer, and your transformer implementation \nwill decide what to do with this language.  Dumper Command  #  This command is intended for a single sitemap generation. You must provide the\nname of the builder as each builder has an associated dumper and a specific \nbasepath used for this built and an optional language.  php app/console elcodi:sitemap:dump main http://localhost:8000\nphp app/console elcodi:sitemap:dump main https://myurl.com\nphp app/console elcodi:sitemap:dump main http://localhost:8000 --language=es  Profiles  #  Using the dumper is so nice and easy if you just manage static languages, but\nhow about if our site needs to generate several builders using, for example, all \nthe enabled languages of our site?  In order to solve this common problem, this bundle provides as well what we call\na sitemap profile.  elcodi_sitemap:\n\n    # A profile is a set of builders, grouped and combined with all available\n    # languages. Special for bulk actions\n    profile:\n        main:\n            # Service reference, result which is an array of languages\n            languages: elcodi.languages_iso_array\n            # Set of builder references\n            builders:\n                - main  There are two elements to be defined here, both required.  First, we need to decide what builders we want to include in this profile.\nThis is just a set of builders, an array. That easy.  Second, we must define a service in our project, intended to return all enabled\nlanguages in our site. This service must return an array of locales.  In elcodi we have a service called  elcodi.languages_iso .  elcodi.languages_iso_array:\n    class: stdClass\n    factory: [@elcodi.languages_iso, toArray]   Yes, in Symfony a service can use the factory pattern to return a simple \narray using the stdClass keyword.   Elcodi generates a service for each profile, using our standard. In our example, \nwith the given configuration we will have available a new public service.  elcodi.sitemap_profile.main  Calling this service, the DI will create a SitemapProfile instance, ready\nto be used.  /**\n * Class SitemapProfile\n */\nclass SitemapProfile\n{\n    /**\n     * Build full profile\n     *\n     * @param string $basepath Basepath\n     *\n     * @return $this Self object\n     */\n    public function dump($basepath);\n}  Profile Command  #  This command is intended for profile generation. You must provide the\nname of the profile and a specific basepath used for this build.  php app/console elcodi:sitemap:profile main http://localhost:8000\nphp app/console elcodi:sitemap:profile main https://myurl.com",
